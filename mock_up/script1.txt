    ##### 2 LEATHER EYEWEAR "AJI"

        LEATHER EYEWEAR "AJI"
            GRADUATION WORK AT TAMA ART UNIVERSITY 2014
                There's no perfect English literal translation for the Japanese sentence "Aji ga aru". In many cases, it is translated as “having a taste", “having a flavor", or etc. But the word “Aji" can refer to the good old fashioned things or it also can refer to the dignity and atmosphere of a person so I mean, we can see that literal translation can't fully express the nuances of the word. Therefore, at this work, I designed and expressed the Japanese word "Aji" by using the classical motif, which is glasses that strongly impress the wearer's atmosphere. The history of eyewear products itself is very old, and the materials used range from tortoiseshell to wood, metal, acetate and other plastics, and recently titanium has been used to improve durability and reduce weight. In this design work, I thought that by using leather, which is not commonly used as a material for such glasses, I could combine the change of age with the glasses. In a process of the trial, I succeeded to create the glasses without using metal parts by using several processing methods of leather material. Herewith, it is possible to make the product of glasses more diversified.

                MAKING MOVIE (HOW TO MAKE EYEWEAR) 2014

                Youtube: https://youtu.be/n0Pmn40bPkI

                In order to broaden the world view of the work, I had the models wear it for a portrait shooting. I deliberately used a young age close friend as a model, defying the notion of old age and intelligence that defines the word. I felt that I could express a more raw and pure taste if the person I intuitively felt had more flavor. A student of graphic design, he was a fan of Tsuguharu Fujita and had a deep knowledge of painting, and was a quiet, yet somehow enlightened figure. His personality embodied in the act of wearing glasses is very natural and very impressive, and it gave us the opportunity to change the shape of glasses, which were initially only in the Boston shape.

                After that, as a developmental form, I increased the variation of eyeglasses by pasting crocodile or leather of embossing on the frame once made, impregnating coarse particle paints like gesso or modeling paste to make a new surface texture, etc. The use of materials other than leather, which had not been planned to be used in the first place, was used in a balanced and effective manner. And there is a type which is the use of metal in some parts added delicacy. By removing the conceptual framework, the product has become something that shows the diversity of human senses in the way it is.

                The later progress, design, and expression is continued even now with updating the design of the product.
                There are two examples that came from relationships with the leather-related people and daily research. One of the cases is the type looks like a wallet. The gesture of opening a long wallet, and the act to tie a lace produce courteousness of the person. Another one has a substantially identical texture resembling human skin. I produced to make feelings warmth and gentleness from smooth and warm touch, with the use of reference the technique of Foujita Tsuguharu for painting human skin on the canvas with paint blending talc.
                Approaching nuances that cannot be shaped into words is  the most important process in my own design works. I'm designing with consideration not only adopting progressive manufacturing processes but also important sensuous consideration for myself even now.

        EXHIBITION “FETICHE”
        COLLABORATED ART EXHIBITION WITH YOHEI NOBE
            In a space under the JR Akihabara Station viaduct, which was about to undergo a major renovation project, we received a request from a photographer, Yohei Nobe, to exhibit a joint work. we developed artwork mainly on photographic works on the theme of fetishism. Philosophically, we considered a system that appeals to humans, and gave and expressed motifs and themes from various perspectives.

            Inspired by the Latin word "Facticius", the origin of the word, I created a work focusing on fruit seeds, objects that are shaped by natural forces. It captures how the inherent value of natural seeds changes as a result of discoloration caused by the artificial process of coloring.
            
            These works were expanded as novelties such as postcards and can badges. And, I created typography for the exhibition title with the theme of "the process of changing the existing value of objects".

    ##### 5 SHOES DESIGN COLLECTION 'BOHEME'
    https://www.shun-yoshikawa.com/shoes_design_collection_boheme
        SHOES DESIGN COLLECTION 'BOHEME'
        JOINT RESEARCH PROJECT WITH CAMPER ( DESIGN THEMA “TRAVEL” )
            Early 20th Century, there was a painter named Tsuguharu Fujita ( he became French and changed his name to Leonard Fujita.). The times when the airfare was not cheap as now and without the Internet, he had a very strong admiration to Paris where it was said to be the highest level of the art world and he desired to take a journey to Paris. He went to Paris immediately after graduating from Tokyo art University. In Paris, he met Modigliani, Chaim Soutine and Pablo Picasso and he saw the free and new pictures completely different from Japanese pictures. He had traveled many times during two times world war because he had a so huge passionate mind for Paris and he loved not only Paris but also art even if he was in a exceptionally poor situation.

            As I was thinking about my design proposal following the theme of "travel", I noticed a painter named Leonard Fujita. During the time, when travel was so difficult and there was also war, his free lifestyle which living as Bohemian and going back and forth so often between Paris and Japan was just the symbol of travel. I thought he could be an icon of the theme travel, so I focused on him in designing the shoes.

            Thread the string freely through the myriad of lace holes. The design has been characterized by the act of putting on their shoes before going out, a traditional behavior that only Japanese people do just before a trip. And, to express the free and open atmosphere of the Bohemian, I did not put a counter in the heel and devised a structure to give it an overall soft feel. but I also wanted to include a classic impression as a leather shoe, so the toe shape is square and the stitching is a large pitch with thick yarn count thread. For the final color scheme, I created the orthodox black, tea-brown, skin-white and night blue, which is Montparnasse's color of the night that is the town Fujita might have enjoyed playing at night.

Up to now, In order to introduce embedded Deep Learning systems, advanced and expertise knowledge for both software and hardware were required during the process from model design to hardware implementation. This kit has a complete set of hardware necessary to implement Deep Learning on a palmtop device. By using DeLTA-Kit, the Deep Learning model generated by DeLTA-Lite (Inference Model Generation App)  can be deployed easily on hardware.

            This is an exclusive case for the De10SoC board that makes it possible to protect its fragile circuit parts. By fastening this case and De10-nano with included metal components, DeLTA-Kit is possible to be used as a palmtop device of the demo specification. The shape of the outerwear was designed in reasonable shape for the heat exhaust and operable pin positions of the De10SoC. Making easily to set up and operate demonstrations without having to touch the Cyclone® V FPGA chip or the included other CPU.

            Initially, LeapMind provided a set of SoC boards and adapters (except for the outer part), plus a sample classification inference model (installed in the micro SD) program.

            In Leap Mind inc, developed our own SoC device for a palm-sized Deep Learning practical verification kit. By making it more compact, it was proposed as an AI-Box with an integrated camera. I designed a structure that stacks necessary parts underneath, except for the camera and accelerator board. It is also envisaged that input devices such as microphones, which replace the camera that is supposed to be used for image processing, will be able to be switched out.

            A demonstration of a parking management system using an inference model to detect vehicles in a parking lot was given. Along with the type-ii, a Raspberry-Pi was installed on the back of the vehicle, and an LED indicator was also created to show empty and full parking spaces. The detection of the vehicle is performed by reasoning with type-ii and can be checked on the management screen.

            For the aim of increasing variations in forms and user interfaces, I also created the following for these versions.
            One with a camera lens for high-definition image input, one with a mobile battery, and another is that connects to a PoE hub for LAN power feeding.

    人体における髪は、人間と極めて密接に存在する物の一つであり、且つその在り方を作為的に変化させられてしまう物です。
    そのもの自体が誕生する過程に関与できなかった人間が崇拝可能なチャームへと在り方を転換させる行為はフェティシズムの一貫であると言えます。
    趣向を意味するフェティシュという言葉の裏側には、自然発生的なフォルムを人間にとって好都合なフォルムへと転換することで、人間の創作欲求を満たす、道具を発明した唯一の種である人間の根本的性質という意味が隠されている。

    In a space under the JR Akihabara Station viaduct, which was about to undergo a major renovation project, we received a request from a photographer, Yohei Nobe, to exhibit a joint work. He develops artwork mainly on photographic works on the theme of fetishism. Philosophically, he considered a system that appeals to humans, and gave and expressed motifs and themes from various perspectives.
    Inspired by the Latin word Factesius, the origin of the word, he created a work focusing on fruit seeds, objects that are shaped by supernatural forces. It captures how the inherent value of seeds changes with discoloration.
    These works were developed as novelties such as postcard
    s and can badges. And, the typography for the exhibition title was created with the theme of "the process of changing the existing value of objects".
    When a naturally-occurring object changes its existence into an artifact by an external factor, it exhibits a kind of magical effect. Hair in the human body is one of the things that exist very closely with humans, and that can change the way it is artificially. The act of transforming a person into a worshipable charm that could not be involved in the process of being born itself is a part of fetishism.
